Autohotkey Networking Tools


This is a script containing basic networking tools. 

While other hotkeys are present, the main tool would be IP_Tools by using the capslock hotkey.

Either from your clipboard, selected text, or manually entering IP information, IP tools will offer multiple options for getting information using those network addresses.
